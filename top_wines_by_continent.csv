7335,Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Occhio di Pernice,100,210.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,,,Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi,Europe,True,Muy Alto
45798,US,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",,100,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale,North America,True,Muy Alto
